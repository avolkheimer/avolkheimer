## Cytometry in R

Location: Durham, NC, USA (Duke)

My Favorite Fluorophore/Metal-Isotope: I don't think I have a favorite. We use panels ~20 fluors on a spectral cytometer.

Previous Coding Experience: I took some online workshops from our library last year which included coding in RStudio, but I don't really remember how to do it.

What I Hope to Get From This Course: I would like to become more fluent in R, and flow cytometry is something that I use frequently so it seems like a good topic.
